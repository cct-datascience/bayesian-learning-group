Collectively we have a diversity of research interests, backgrounds in statistics and programming, and objectives for the semester. We will share our knowledge and our curiosity, and we will welcome questions, experiments, and intellectual risk-taking. We will collectively commit to maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for all (see the Code of Conduct, below)."

You are encouraged to read the corresponding chapters and/or watch the accompanying video lectures in between sessions, but we will try to provide enough background context to make working through the examples a valuable exercise on its own.\nWe will be starting from Chapter 9 (MCMC). Some background in statistics is helpful, but interest is more important! You do not need to have participated in the spring series, or to have attended previous sessions, to join any session throughout the semester.\nWe also welcome model “show-and-tell” (where volunteers talk us through all of the nerdy model details you usually don’t get to talk about in your papers and talks!) and guest speakers throughout the semester."
