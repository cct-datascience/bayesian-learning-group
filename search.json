Or, at least, absorb the philosophy and conceptual underpinnings of a Bayesian approach, and learn to build and interpret Bayesian models using modern software packages.\nSupport each other in this quest. Collectively we have a diversity of research interests, backgrounds in statistics and programming, and objectives for the semester. We will share our knowledge and our curiousity, and we will welcome questions, experiments, and intellectual risk-taking. We will collectively commit to maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for all (see the Code of Conduct, below)."

No need to both read and watch - we suggest picking your favorite modality and setting aside an hour or two in the “off week” between meetings to absorb the content.\nIn-session, we’ll have a quick discussion reminding ourselves of the content, and then spend most of our time helping each other work through examples and use cases from your own work (if you have them).\nWe will encourage you to keep a digital notebook of your progress as a GitHub repository that you can refer back to later. We’ll also curate resources as a group for future reference (and in case anyone misses a session and wants to catch up).\nThe structure and format of this learning group is ultimately what we make it! Suggestions and meta-brainstorming are welcome."
