## R implementations

### `rethinking`

[McElreath's rethinking package](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/).

To install `rethinking`, you will first need to install [`cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/).
Follow the instructions [here](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/).
Note that if you do not have CmdStan and a C++ toolchain installed, you'll need to install those as well.
There are instructions [here](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/).
This can take a while!

### `brms`

[This bookdown book](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/) works through the examples and problem questions in McElreath's book using `brms`.

[Here's](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/) a link to the `brms` package.

### `rstan`

[Here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/rethinking2/) is an implementation in R and stan.
